This is the solution for foundation degree's second year android project.

Due to time constraits I was unable to implement a database and for this reason test data is hard-coded.

The app uses the current time to find a sheduled class. I then presents the user with names of pupils and allows the user to
mark their attendance. Marking the student as absent sends their name to the back of the queue in case tey show at a later time.
Attending student are removed from the queue.
